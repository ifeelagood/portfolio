# Portfolio

- tetris_cpp is a poorly made, unfinished clone of NES tetris utilising OpenGL and freeglut
- booking_webapp was my major project for IB Computer Science, and utilises the Poco libraries in C++ to make a barebones website in too many lines of code
- extended_essay was my extended essay for the IB in computer science, provided for sample of academic writing skills


## Cloning

Make sure to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to populate submodules
